                    ['MATLAB is an interactive programming environment for scientific computing. MATLAB is heavily used in many technical fields for data analysis, problem solving, and for experimentation and algorithm development. Discipline-specific software written in MATLAB, organized into libraries of functions called toolboxes, is widely used as well. MATLAB has found extensive use as the basis for computational laboratory work in technical education; more than 1000 textbooks use MATLAB as a teaching vehicle. MATLAB is a product of The Mathworks of Natick, Massachusetts, USA. There is general agreement in the technical computing community that the main reasons for MATLABs success are its intuitive, concise syntax, the use of complex matrices as the default numeric data object, the power of the built-in operators, easily used graphics, and its simple and friendly programming environment, allowing easy extension of the language. To this one can add the reliability of the numerical methods on which the operators are based.MATLAB introduced some notational conveniences that make it easy to express ideas about matrices more compactly than had been possible. Most notable are the concatenation operations: [A, B] (the matrix whose columns are the columns of A followed by those of B) and [A; B] (the vertical concatenation, whose rows are the rows of A followed by those of B). Other notational innovations include A for the transpose of the matrix A, A.* B for the Hadamard(element by element) product of two matrices, and A\b for the computation of the product of the inverse of a matrix(A) with a vector(b).MATLAB allows a function to have several outputs, with the syntax[x, y, z] = f(a, b, c).The m by n matrix all of whose elements are 1 is generated by the function ones(m, n), while zeros(m, n) and rand(m, n) generate the zero matrix and a matrix with independent uniform random elements.The identity of order n is known in MATLAB as eye(n).']
